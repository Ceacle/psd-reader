Change log for psd-reader
-------------------------

0.6.0 BETA
ADD: Resource chunks parser and new property info.resources (+ parseResources(), findResource(id)).
CHG: Internal changes, refactoring gamma processing

0.5.3 BETA
FIX: Cleaning up error handling in fetch method (private)

0.5.2 BETA
CHG: Prevent 32-bit depth images to be de-matted (currently a rounding error problem exist with this mode)
CHG: Indexed mode no longer sets hasAlpha in info object despite it has transparency, as there is no actual channel for alpha.

0.5.1 BETA
CHG: Prevent indexed images to be de-matted as they don't suffer from this problem.

0.5.0 BETA
ADD: De-matter - removes the halo in images with alpha channel.
ADD: New option "noDematte"

0.4.10 BETA
CHG: Minor optimization with gamma LUT if gamma = 1 (for 32-bits mode)
FIX: Event for toRGBA() did not link rgba bitmap correctly as reference inside event object

0.4.9 BETA
CHG: optimized bitmap decoder++
CHG: Refactored rgb/grey
FIX: ignoreAlpha was ignored for some color modes

0.4.8 BETA
ADD: New option: noRGBA with accompanying method toRGBA(). Loads and decompresses the data, but does not convert to RGBA.

0.4.7 BETA
ADD: Option to ignore alpha channel
CHG: Optimized Lab conversion speed
CHG: Lab range for ab increased to full signed byte

0.4.6 BETA
ADD: Check in toCanvas to prevent HQ mode to be used when target size is larger than original.
CHG: Internal - merged util module into core
CHG: Internal - separated out RGBA conversion, toRGBA is now "master" dispatcher.

0.4.5 BETA
FIX: L*ab colors now shows correctly
CHG: Internal changes

0.4.1 BETA
REM: removing crossOrigin option (was a little too caught up in how CORS works with Image...).
CHG: Internal changes/code trimming/optimizations/minimize tricks

0.4.0 BETA
ADD: Scaling option for toCanvas, with optional high-quality mode.
ADD: Support of passive mode for options - load data but don't parse until new parse() method is invoked (use onReady event for urls)

0.3.1 BETA
FIX: A take on DuoTone. Reads in the data as grey (w/support for alpha) and uses new option "duotone" with RGB array color to mix it with.

0.3.0 BETA
ADD: Gamma support through two new options: "gamma" and "gamma32" (see docs)
ADD: Added new property "indexes" for info object showing number of indexed colors
FIX: Transparency for indexed color mode now supported (added resource scanner, not optimized, trigger only for indexed).
CHG: Internal refactoring and optimizations

0.2.1 BETA
FIX: Global error handler wasn't set until after parser was invoked

0.2.0 BETA
CHG: !IMPORTANT: toCanvas() is now *synchronous returning the canvas element* instead of using a callback.
IMP: Better error checking when creating canvas
IMP: Minor internal improvements
FIX: If error in fetch it would never be called properly
FIX: Wrong error text with invalid data chunk/mode
REM: Removed unused check block
REM: Unused info properties

0.1.0 BETA
NEW: Initial release
